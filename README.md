## 🧘 Stage 1: Title and Introduction

Humble Time Tracker is a cross-platform time management and emotional pacing app built in Flutter. It was born from the legacy of MindfullyMosaic — a Python-based desktop suite — and reimagined for mobile-first, multilingual, and neurodivergent-friendly use.

This project blends scheduling, journaling, voice synthesis, and adaptive UI into a calming experience. It was developed to support users navigating ADHD, autism, anxiety, and executive functioning challenges — with tools that listen, adapt, and affirm.

## 📜 Stage 6: Backstory and Legacy

### 💡 Origins
Humble Time Tracker began as a personal response to the challenges of emotional pacing and time awareness. Its predecessor, MindfullyMosaic, introduced journaling, budgeting, and meditation in a desktop suite. Humble builds on that foundation with mobile-first design, voice synthesis, and multilingual support.

#

### 🧠 Neurodiversity and Emotional Design
The app was designed with neurodivergent users in mind — including those with ADHD, autism, and sensory sensitivities.

**It supports:**
- **Emotional pacing** – Voice cues and gentle transitions reduce overwhelm
- **Visual clarity** – Clean layouts and semantic icons support cognitive ease
- **Routine anchoring** – Calendar streaks and journaling prompts create rhythm
- **Offline privacy** – No external APIs or cloud sync required
- **Low-friction interaction** – Predictable flows and minimal typing

#

### 🧪 Stage 7: Development Notes
Modular architecture with separate components for voice, journal, and calendar

All assets included in the repo; no external dependencies required

.env support for optional email reminders (future enhancement)

Designed for accessibility, with adjustable pacing and language support

## 🔑 Stage 8: Licence and Contribution

### 🔑 Licence

This project is released under the MIT Licence. 

See the full license in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.

#

🤝 Contributions
This is currently a solo academic project for MSc Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London. Feedback, UX insights, and neurodiversity design suggestions are warmly welcomed via GitHub Issues.

#

### 🧩 Optional Enhancements

Humble Time Tracker is stable — but its architecture leaves room for thoughtful expansion. If you're inspired to build on this foundation, here are a few ideas that could deepen its impact:

- **Wearable Integration** – Vibration cues and ambient timers for routine anchoring
- **Voice Journaling** – Record reflections via microphone, transcribed and stored securely
- **Encrypted Cloud Sync** – Optional backup for users who want cross-device access while preserving privacy
- **Accessibility Presets** – Toggle neurodivergent-friendly modes (e.g., reduced motion, simplified UI, haptic feedback)
- **Routine Streaks & Gamified Nudges** – Gentle encouragement for habit formation and emotional pacing

This project remains open to reinterpretation. Whether you're a developer, designer, researcher, or someone who cares about mindful tech — your ideas are welcome.

Feel free to fork, remix, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate on future iterations or contribute to its evolution.

### 🛤️ Personal Journey
Humble Time Tracker is the continuation of a journey that began with MindfullyMosaic. It taught me that software can be gentle, interfaces can be kind, and design can hold space for healing. It reflects my belief that technology should listen — not just respond.
