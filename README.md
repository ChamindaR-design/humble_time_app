Humble: A Neurodiversity-Informed Time
# Humble: A Neurodiversity-Informed Time Management Application

Humble is a mobile-first time management app designed to support neurodiverse usersâ€”particularly those with ADHD, autism, and executive functioning challengesâ€”through adaptive, emotionally-aware productivity tools.

Originally prototyped in Python under the name **MindfullyMosaic**, the project has evolved toward a Flutter/Dart-based final implementation to meet cross-platform accessibility, responsive UI, and inclusive design goals.

## ðŸŒˆ Project Origins

As a neurodivergent developer, my workflow is inherently shaped by cascading effectsâ€”the "butterfly effect"â€”where small insights trigger expansive changes. The early Python prototype (MindfullyMosaic) introduced features like modular tab design, voice reminders, and mindfulness trackers. These became the foundation for Humble, refined through human-centered design and platform migration.
